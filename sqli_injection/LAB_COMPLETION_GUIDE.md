# Advanced SQL Injection Lab - Complete Package

## üìÅ File Structure
Your SQL Injection lab is now ready with the following files:

### Core Lab Files:
- `login.php` - Vulnerable login form (POST-based SQLi)
- `products.php` - Vulnerable product lookup (GET-based SQLi)
- `setup.sql` - Database initialization script

### Security Implementations:
- `login_secure.php` - Secured version with prepared statements
- `products_secure.php` - Secured version with input validation

### Documentation:
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions
- `ATTACK_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Attack techniques and payloads

---

## üéØ Next Steps for Lab Completion

### Phase 1: Environment Setup ‚úÖ
1. Install XAMPP and start Apache/MySQL services
2. Create `sqli_lab` folder in `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
3. Copy all PHP files to the lab folder
4. Execute `setup.sql` in phpMyAdmin to create database

### Phase 2: Initial Testing
Follow the setup guide to verify:
- [ ] `http://localhost/sqli_lab/login.php` - Test with alice/password
- [ ] `http://localhost/sqli_lab/products.php?id=101` - Verify Secure Firewall displays
- [ ] Take required screenshots for Deliverable 1

### Phase 3: SQL Injection Attacks
Use the attack documentation to perform:

#### A. In-Band SQL Injection (login.php)
Test these payloads in the username field:
- `admin' --`
- `' OR '1'='1' --`
- `' UNION SELECT username, role, secret_flag FROM users WHERE role='admin' --`

#### B. Union-Based SQL Injection (products.php)
Test these URLs:
- `http://localhost/sqli_lab/products.php?id=101' UNION SELECT username, secret_flag FROM users--`
- `http://localhost/sqli_lab/products.php?id=101' UNION SELECT username, secret_flag FROM users WHERE role='admin'--`

#### C. Error-Based SQL Injection (login.php modified)
1. Uncomment error reporting line in login.php
2. Test payloads that trigger MySQL errors to extract information

### Phase 4: Defense Implementation
Compare vulnerable vs. secure versions:
- Test that secure versions prevent all attack vectors
- Document the security improvements

## üìä Expected Results

### Database Content:
- **alice** (user): `USER_FLAG_ABC123`
- **bob** (user): `USER_FLAG_DEF456`
- **admin** (admin): `FLAG_SQLI_COMPLETE_ZXY789`

### Attack Success Indicators:
- Authentication bypass successful
- Secret flags extracted via UNION attacks
- Database schema information disclosed
- Admin credentials compromised

### Security Testing:
- Prepared statements prevent all SQLi attempts
- Input validation blocks malicious payloads
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information

---

## üîç Key Learning Objectives

1. **Understand SQLi Mechanics**: See how user input directly affects SQL queries
2. **Master Attack Types**: Practice In-Band, Union-Based, and Error-Based techniques
3. **Learn Defense Strategies**: Implement prepared statements and input validation
4. **Security Assessment**: Compare vulnerable vs. secure implementations

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Demonstrated

### Input Validation:
```php
$product_id = isset($_GET['id']) ? intval($_GET['id']) : 101;
```

### Prepared Statements:
```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE product_id = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("i", $product_id);
```

### Output Encoding:
```php
echo htmlspecialchars($row['name']);
```

### Error Handling:
- Don't expose database errors to users
- Use generic error messages
- Log detailed errors for debugging

## üì∏ Documentation Requirements

For each attack, document:
1. **Payload Used**: Exact input that caused the vulnerability
2. **Screenshot**: Show the successful attack result
3. **Analysis**: Explain why the attack worked
4. **Impact**: What information was compromised
5. **Mitigation**: How the secure version prevents it

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations

This lab is for educational purposes only:
- Only test on your local XAMPP environment
- Never attempt these techniques on systems you don't own
- Understand the legal implications of unauthorized testing
- Use knowledge responsibly for defensive purposes
